half teaspoon|fine sea salt,;

Melt butter over medium heat in a Dutch oven or large saucepan.
Add onion wedges, water, can of tomatoes with their juices, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Bring
to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally and add additional salt
as needed.
Blend the soup, and then season to taste. The soup doesn’t need to be ultra-smooth, some
texture is a nice touch. An immersion blender does make quick work of this, or you can use a
blender. If you use a regular blender, it is best to blend in batches and not fill the blender as
much as you usually would since the soup is so hot. We like to remove the center insert of
the lid and cover it with a kitchen towel while blending — this helps to release some of the
steam and prevents the blender lid from popping off (which can be a big, hot mess).;
